# Hey, I'm asdfaw021 👋

A coder 👨‍💻 from a small town 📍, fueled by a passion for programming and a dream 🚀 of breaking into the tech world. I’m a student at a tech college, grinding my way toward independence through code. My tools are Java, UNIX-like systems 🐧, and a commitment to open-source software ❤️.

## Skills & Toolbox 🛠️

-   **Languages**: Java ⭐ (my core focus), some C in the past.
-   **Projects**: Built a [taskmanager](https://github.com/asdfaw021/taskmanager) 📁 with ArrayList and JSON saving via Gson. Next steps: Adding some database 💾 and Spring Boot 🌱.
-   **Problem-Solving**: Working on problems at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/asdfaw021/) 🎯. Also reading Shildt’s *Java: The Complete Reference* 📖 and *Grokking Algorithms* 🧠 in progress.
-   **OS**: Running Debian 12 with BSPWM 🖥️ — lightweight, customizable, and open-source.
-   **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, and a terminal `>_`.
-   **Interests**: Open-source software 🌐, UNIX-like operating systems (Debian, FreeBSD on my radar 😈), and the history of computing 📜.

## Current Missions 🎯

-   **Yandex Backend School**: Prepping for the June 2025 cohort 🎓. Registration’s open till April 27, 2025. Goal: Sharpen my Java skills and deliver a solid project.
-   **T-Bank Internship**: Applied March 26, 2025. Exam results were average, but it’s a fallback option ⚓.
-   **Task Manager Evolution**: Adding some database for persistence and exploring Spring Boot to level it up ⬆️.

## Why Open Source? ❤️

I’m all in for software that’s free 🔓, transparent, and built by the community 🤝. It’s about empowerment through code, and I’m here to learn and contribute.

## Tech Fascinations 🤩

-   **UNIX-like OS**: Hooked on their flexibility and depth — Debian’s my daily driver 🐧, and FreeBSD’s on my to-explore list 😈.
-   **Computer History**: Love digging into how we got from punch cards to modern systems 💾🕰️. The tales of UNIX, ARPANET, and early hackers keep me going.
    ## What’s Next? 🤔➡️

Turning late-night coding into a career. Stick around if you’re into Java, open-source projects, or just curious if I’ll make it. ✨
