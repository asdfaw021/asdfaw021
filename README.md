# Hey, I'm asdfaw021

A coder from a small town, fueled by a passion for programming and a dream of breaking into the tech world. I’m a student at a tech college, grinding my way toward independence through code. My tools are Java, UNIX-like systems, and a commitment to open-source software.

## Skills & Toolbox

- **Languages**: Java (my core focus), some C in the past.
- **Projects**: Built a [task manager](https://github.com/asdfaw021/taskmanager) with ArrayList and JSON saving via Gson. Next steps: Adding some database and Spring Boot.
- **Problem-Solving**: Working on problems at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/asdfaw021/). Also reading Shildt’s *Java: The Complete Reference* and *Grokking Algorithms* in progress.
- **OS**: Running Debian 12 with BSPWM — lightweight, customizable, and open-source.
- **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, and a terminal I’ve made my own.
- **Interests**: Open-source software, UNIX-like operating systems (Debian, FreeBSD on my radar), and the history of computing.

## Current Missions

- **Yandex Backend School**: Prepping for the June 2025 cohort. Registration’s open till April 27, 2025. Goal: Sharpen my Java skills and deliver a solid project.
- **T-Bank Internship**: Applied March 26, 2025. Exam results were average, but it’s a fallback option.
- **Task Manager Evolution**: Adding some database for persistence and exploring Spring Boot to level it up.

## Why Open Source?

I’m all in for software that’s free, transparent, and built by the community. It’s about empowerment through code, and I’m here to learn and contribute.

## Tech Fascinations

- **UNIX-like OS**: Hooked on their flexibility and depth — Debian’s my daily driver, and FreeBSD’s on my to-explore list.
- **Computer History**: Love digging into how we got from punch cards to modern systems. The tales of UNIX, ARPANET, and early hackers keep me going.

## What’s Next?

Turning late-night coding into a career. Stick around if you’re into Java, open-source projects, or just curious if I’ll make it.
