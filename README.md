# Hey, I'm asdfaw021 👋

A coder 👨‍💻 from a small town 📍, driven by a passion for programming and a dream 🚀 of breaking into the tech world. I’m a student at a tech college, currently grinding my way toward independence through code. My core tools are Java, UNIX-like systems 🐧, and a strong commitment to open-source software ❤️.

## Skills & Toolbox 🛠️

Here's a snapshot of my current technical landscape:

- **Languages**: Java ⭐ (my core focus), with some past experience in C.
- **Projects**: Developed a [taskmanager](https://github.com/asdfaw021/taskmanager) 📁 using Java, ArrayLists, and JSON persistence via Gson. Next steps involve integrating a database 💾 and exploring Spring Boot 🌱.
- **Problem-Solving**: Actively honing my algorithmic skills on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/asdfaw021/) 🎯. Currently studying Shildt’s *Java: The Complete Reference* 📖 and *Grokking Algorithms* 🧠.
- **OS**: Daily driving Debian 12 with BSPWM 🖥️ — chosen for its lightweight nature, customizability, and open-source philosophy.
- **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, and a terminal `>_`.
- **Interests**: Open-source software 🌐, the architecture of UNIX-like operating systems (Debian, FreeBSD 😈), and the history of computing 📜.

## Current Missions 🎯

My immediate focus is on these key objectives:

- **Yandex Backend School**: Preparing intensively for the June 2025 cohort 🎓 (registration open until April 27, 2025). My goal is to deepen my Java expertise and deliver a compelling project.
- **T-Bank Internship**: Applied March 26, 2025. While my exam results were average, I view this as a valuable fallback option ⚓.
- **TaskManager Evolution**: Enhancing my project by adding database persistence and leveling up with Spring Boot ⬆️.

## Why Open Source? ❤️

I believe strongly in software that is free 🔓, transparent, and community-driven 🤝. For me, open source represents empowerment through shared code, and I'm eager to learn from and contribute to this ecosystem.

## Tech Fascinations 🤩

- **UNIX-like OS**: Captivated by their flexibility and design philosophy — Debian 🐧 is my go-to, with FreeBSD 😈 high on my list to explore.
- **Computer History**: Fascinated by the evolution from punch cards 💾 to modern systems 🕰️. The stories behind UNIX, ARPANET, and pioneering hackers are a constant source of inspiration.

## What’s Next? 🤔➡️

The goal is simple: turn late-night coding sessions into a fulfilling career. Stick around if you're interested in Java development, open-source exploration, or just curious to see how the journey unfolds. ✨
